## Describe the gnocchi endpoint used by ceilometer
gnocchi_service_proto: http
gnocchi_service_port: 8041
gnocchi_service_internaluri_proto: "{{ openstack_service_internaluri_proto | default(gnocchi_service_proto) }}"
gnocchi_service_internalurl: "{{ gnocchi_service_internaluri_proto }}://{{ internal_lb_vip_address }}:{{ gnocchi_service_port }}"

## Ensure gnocchiclient is installed on the ceilometer collectors

  - libvirt-python
  - gnocchiclient

## Demonstrating the expected configurations necessary to use gnocchi as the ceilometer dispatcher
## These must be disabled because of an issue in config_template and the use of MultiStrOpt in Ceilometer
## NOTE(stevelle) no support for storing events in gnocchi, so eliminate dispatchers and refuse to store
ceilometer_ceilometer_conf_overrides:
  DEFAULT:
    event_dispatchers: ""
    meter_dispatchers: gnocchi
  collector:
    batch_size: 10
    batch_timeout: 5
  notification:
    store_events: false
  storage:
    max_retries: 80
  dispatcher_gnocchi:
    archive_policy: low
## Demonstrating expected ceilometer configs necessary ONLY to use swift for
##   gnocchi storage under ceilometer
## NOTE(stevelle): using a filter at dispatcher is inferior to filtering in
##   ceilometermiddleware on Swift however facts and registered variable scopes
##   are a bit volatile for use in the ceilometermiddleware configuration e.g.
##   https://github.com/openstack/ceilometermiddleware/blob/master/ceilometermiddleware/swift.py#L39
##   and this is just easier than extracting the project_id expected by that
##   middleware and making all the changes necessary in the middleware needed
##   to get it to perform the necessary filtering without getting fingers too
##   deep into the swift role.
    filter_service_activity: true
    filter_project: "{{ gnocchi_service_project_name }}"

## Demonstrating the expected configurations necessary to use ceph for storage
#    driver: ceph
#    ceph_username: gnocci
#    ceph_keyring: "/etc/ceph/ceph.client.{{ gnocchi_service_user_name }}.keyring"


## Demonstrating expected configs required to use gnocchi meters for aodh alarming
aodh_aodh_conf_overrides:
  DEFAULT:
    gnocchi_url: "{{ gnocchi_service_internalurl }}"

## FUTURE(stevelle)
# disable ceilometer-api: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/270818/
